- 👋 Hi, I’m @seadubya
- 👀 I’m interested in building stuff internally for my many ideas...most of which will probably fail.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use VS Code instead of Visual Studio all the time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mentoring technical founders who could use a devil's advocate when it comes to biz stuff.
